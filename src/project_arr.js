  overview1: `Lexitoken is a software application designed to analyze the structure of computer programs. It separates the program into individual words, characters, and punctuation marks, and then labels them based on their function (like reserved words or operators). This process, called tokenization, is a foundational step for many program analysis tasks.`,

  overview2: `Lexitoken works for code written in C, C++, Python, and Java. Users can paste or upload their code, and Lexitoken will break it down into its basic components. This can help programmers understand the code better, identify errors, or even modify the code in some way. The application itself is web-based, so it can be accessed from any standard web browser.`,

  overview3: `Overall, Lexitoken is a valuable tool for developers and programmers. It can simplify code analysis, improve comprehension, and even assist with debugging. By providing a clear view of the program's structure, Lexitoken empowers developers to work more effectively with their code.`,
